\
\
Her eyes are windows to her soul, \
A place of peace and contentment.\
I can see the satisfaction in her gaze, \
A joy that knows no bounds.

She is at peace with herself and the world, \
A contentment that is rare. \
She is a beautiful soul, \
And I am grateful to have seen her eyes.

Her eyes are a mirror to her heart, \
And I am drawn to them like a moth to a flame. \
I can't look away, \
For I know that I am seeing something truly special.

She is a gift to this world, \
A blessing to be inspired.\
Her presence is like a warm ray of sunshine, \
That chases away the darkness and the gloom.\
I will cherish her always, \
And I will never forget the day I saw her eyes.
