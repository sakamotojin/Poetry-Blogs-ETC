Journey of life is like a sine wave . Good and Bad times are evenly distributed throughout the journey , it’s just that everyone one has a different offset . So , don’t be sad enjoy the ride.

As per my assumption success is equal to the dot product of hard work and passion . The lesser the angle between the two quantities the more is the result , which is what we want in life. So , it’s better we align the two as early as possible.

Yes , of course hard work is important in getting success but passion too plays an important role. It’s a very well statistically proven fact. Take any example from history , successful people are those who have worked hard in the direction of their passion.

### **HOW CAN ONE REMAIN HAPPY EVEN IN THE WORST CIRCUMSTANCES ?** <a href="#b92d" id="b92d"></a>

The one thing that turns the concavity of our smile upside down is our “FEAR”. So if we take control our fear our smile can be invariant. Expectations from things ,people ,events and society is root cause of the change.

We live in a probabilistic world. Not every thing is in our control . The one thing that is solely in our control is we ourselves , so why worry about the things that aren’t. Hence , it’s better to accept the result and move on in life.

Some patterns / designs take their own time to shape , no matter how talented or a genius you are . You can’t give birth to a baby in a month , even if you get the most beautiful woman on the planet.

Being happy doesn’t mean that everything is perfect . It means that we have decided to look beyond the imperfections . So be happy and keep the concavity of your smile always upward.
