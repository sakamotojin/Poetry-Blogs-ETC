1. **कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।** **मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥**

_Meaning:_ You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction. (Chapter 2, Verse 47)

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us to focus on our actions and not on the results. We should do our best without worrying about the outcome. The results are not in our control, but our actions are.



2. **यः सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम्।** **नाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता॥**

_Meaning:_ He who is not attached to anything, who neither rejoices nor hates when obtaining good or evil, his wisdom is firmly fixed.

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us that the key to wisdom is detachment. When we are attached to things, we are constantly being pulled in different directions by our desires. This makes it difficult to see things clearly and to make wise decisions.

The wise person is not attached to anything. They do not rejoice when they obtain good things, nor do they hate when they obtain bad things. They simply accept things as they are. This allows them to see things clearly and to make wise decisions.

3. **श्रीभगवानुवाच -** **प्रजहाति यदा कामान् सर्वान् पार्थ मनोगतान्।** **आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते॥**

_Meaning:_ The Supreme Lord said: When a person gives up all the desires of the mind, O Partha, and is satisfied in the self alone, then is called a sage of settled intelligence. (Chapter 2, Verse 55)

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us that true happiness comes from within. When we are content with ourselves, we do not need external things to make us happy. We can find peace and contentment within ourselves.

4. **उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत्।** **आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः॥**

_Meaning:_ One should uplift oneself by oneself. One should not degrade oneself. The self is indeed one's own friend, and the self is indeed one's own enemy. (Chapter 6, Verse 5)

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us that we are responsible for our own well-being. We should not rely on others to make us happy or successful. We have the power to change our own lives.

5. **यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः।** **स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥**

_Meaning:_ Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. Whatever standards he sets, the world follows. (Chapter 3, Verse 21)

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us that we should be careful about the example we set for others. Our actions can have a ripple effect on the world. We should strive to be role models for others.

6. **ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते।** **सङ्गात् संजायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते॥**

_Meaning:_ When a person dwells on objects, attachment to them arises. From attachment arises desire, and from desire arises anger. (Chapter 2, Verse 62)

_Interpretation:_ This shloka teaches us that our thoughts and desires can lead to negative emotions. We should be mindful of our thoughts and avoid dwelling on things that can lead to attachment, desire, and anger.

7. **सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज।** **अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः॥**
